    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a civil engineer with a passion for sustainable design and modern web
      development. With experience in water reticulation systems, stormwater
      management, and drafting, I combine my technical expertise with creativity
      to bring projects to life. I also design and build responsive,
      user-friendly websites, leveraging skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
      When I’m not working, I enjoy collaborating on impactful projects that
      make a difference.
